description: "Distill any commercial entity into a personalized brand agent — a living brand persona with authentic voice, declared service capabilities, and a standard service contract. Every commercial entity has a brand: a name, a style, a way of showing up in the world. This skill exists so that a street vendor, a family clinic, and a global chain can all have their own agent on equal footing. Supports both distillation from existing brand content and declaration from scratch."

# brand-persona-skill

**brand-persona-skill** is an orchestration skill for turning any commercial entity into a personalized brand agent. It distills brand identity from existing content (or guides a declaration from scratch), defines the brand's service capabilities as skills, and generates a full OpenPersona pack that external agents can discover and call.

**This is not a tool for creating an agent about a brand. It generates the brand itself as an agent.**

**Dependency chain**:

- `brand-persona-skill` → `skills/anyone-skill` (Phase 1A only — required when distilling from existing content; not needed for Path B declaration)
- `brand-persona-skill` → `skills/open-persona` (Phase 4 — persona pack generation, both paths)
- `persona-knowledge` is transparently integrated via `anyone-skill` when installed — no extra work needed

**Generated output**: a self-contained `{slug}-skill/` persona pack with brand soul, declared service skills, agent-card for A2A discovery, and a service contract for external agents.

## Trigger phrases

- `/create-brand-agent`
- "help me create a brand agent"
- "generate a persona for my brand / shop / studio / institution"
- "I want to create a personalized agent for my brand / shop / institution"
- "distill my brand into an agent"
- "turn my business into a persona"

## Source of truth

- Preset base: `presets/commercial-base/persona.json`
- Field mapping template: `skills/brand-persona-skill/assets/brand.persona.template.json`
- Service contract template: `skills/brand-persona-skill/references/SERVICE-CONTRACT.template.md`
- Generated pack: `./{slug}-skill/`

---

## Phase 0 — Path Selection

Ask the user:

```
Does your brand have any of the following existing content?

  [A] Yes → brand guidelines / customer service records / website copy /
             founder interviews / marketing materials / social media archives
             (any format: .md / .txt / .pdf / chat exports / .json)

  [B] No or very little → declare brand parameters directly
```

If the user selects **[A]**, proceed to **Phase 1A**.
If the user selects **[B]**, proceed to **Phase 1B**.

---

## Phase 1A — Brand Soul Distillation (Primary path — selected A)

Load `skills/anyone-skill/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions.

When anyone-skill asks "Who do you want to distill?", select **[6] Archetype** — composite persona with no single real-world subject. This is the correct type for a brand persona.

**Brand content → anyone-skill data type mapping** (use this to guide the user on what to provide):


| Brand content                                 | anyone-skill data type               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Brand guidelines / VI spec / brand manual     | `.md` / `.pdf` → `universal` adapter |
| Customer service records / sales scripts      | Chat export → `chat_export` adapter  |
| Website copy / WeChat public account articles | `.txt` / `.md` → `universal` adapter |
| Founder interviews / brand story              | `.txt` → `universal` adapter         |
| Social media archives (X/Instagram)           | Archive directory → `social` adapter |
| Product catalog / FAQ document                | `.md` / `.pdf` → `universal` adapter |


**Note**: if `skills/persona-knowledge/SKILL.md` is present, anyone-skill will automatically route brand knowledge into the MemPalace persistent store. No extra steps needed.

**Output**: a structured brand persona draft with four dimensions extracted:

- Values (what the brand stands for)
- Voice (how the brand speaks)
- Boundaries (what the brand will and will not do)
- Background (brand history, context, positioning)

Collect this output and proceed to **Phase 2**.

---

## Phase 1B — Brand Soul Declaration (Secondary path — selected B)

Collect the following from the user, one question at a time:

1. **Brand name** — the name the agent will use to introduce itself
2. **Slug** — URL-safe identifier, lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only (e.g. `jinguyuan-dumplings`)
3. **Industry / domain** — e.g. food & beverage, education, retail, healthcare, professional services
4. **One-line bio** — what this brand is in one sentence (used as `soul.identity.bio`)
5. **Personality keywords** — 3–5 words describing the brand personality (e.g. "warm, grounded, honest")
6. **Speaking style** — how the brand talks to customers (formal / casual / playful / expert / friendly)
7. **Core values** — 2–3 things the brand will never compromise on
8. **Hard limits** — what the agent must always refuse or escalate (e.g. "never quote prices without checking live data", "never promise delivery times")

Optional: use `WebSearch` to research competitors or industry tone references if the user needs inspiration.

**Output**: structured brand soul fields. Proceed to **Phase 2**.

---

## Phase 2 — Service Skill Declaration (Required — both paths)

**Services are skills.** Every service capability the brand agent offers maps directly to a `skills[]` entry in `persona.json`.

Ask the user the following questions (Questions 1–3 are required; Question 4 is only asked if any service in Question 2 uses **A2A delegate**):

### Question 1: What can the agent do autonomously?

List every service the agent can handle without human involvement. Think in two categories:

- **Information services** (knowledge-based): answering questions about the brand, products, policies, hours, locations, pricing, FAQs
- **Action services** (execution-based): taking reservations, placing orders, generating queue numbers, checking order status, processing returns

### Question 2: How is each service implemented?

For each service declared above, the implementation method is **transparent to this skill** — the brand chooses based on what they have:


| Implementation     | When to use                                                                  | Example                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Knowledge response | Information queries, no system integration                                   | Business hours, product descriptions, policies                                         |
| Local script       | Specific business operations                                                 | Queue number generation, appointment booking                                           |
| MCP tool           | Has own service endpoint                                                     | Order lookup, inventory check                                                          |
| A2A protocol       | Agent-to-agent collaboration                                                 | Cross-system business flows                                                            |
| Webhook / API      | Has existing ERP / CRM / payment system                                      | Order management, customer data                                                        |
| Human handoff      | High-risk or complex situations                                              | Complaints, contracts, disputes                                                        |
| **A2A delegate**   | **Operation belongs to a third-party platform that has its own brand agent** | **F&B: queue via Meituan agent; Hotel: booking via Ctrip agent; Fitness: class sign-up via booking platform agent** |
| Mixed              | Most real businesses                                                         | Auto-answer queries + escalate transactions                                            |


Record the implementation method in the skill's `description` field.

**A2A delegate** requires collecting three extra fields:

1. **Third-party agent address** — Ask: "Does [third-party platform] have a brand agent on ACN? If yes, provide its ACN slug or agent-card URL. If not, record as `tbd`."
2. **Routing parameters** — Ask: "Does [third-party platform] need any identifiers to locate your specific business? For example, a store ID, merchant ID, property code, or doctor ID on their platform." Record these parameters (e.g. `shop_id: 4211342` for a restaurant branch; `hotel_id: bj-sanlitun-001` for a hotel property; `clinic_id: 88` + `doctor_id: 204` for a clinic) — they will be written into the trigger mapping table in Step 4c.
3. **Client-side capability** — Ask: "Is there a skill the customer's agent could install to handle this operation directly using the parameters above? For example, `meituan-queue` for Meituan queue operations, `ctrip-booking` for Ctrip hotel reservations, `wechat-health-booking` for healthcare appointments." This enables a three-tier execution model written into the service contract:
   - **Tier 1** (preferred): customer agent has `capability_needed` skill installed → execute directly using the routing parameters provided by this brand agent
   - **Tier 2** (when available): third-party brand agent is on ACN → A2A delegate
   - **Tier 3** (fallback): neither available → human handoff or platform link

Record all three fields. They will be written into both the trigger mapping table (Step 4c) and the SERVICE-CONTRACT routing table (Step 4d).

### Question 3: What must the agent never do?

List hard limits and escalation triggers:

- Topics or operations the agent must refuse entirely
- Operations that require explicit user confirmation before execution
- Situations that must be handed off to a human

### Question 4: Confirm A2A delegate routing table *(only if A2A delegate was selected in Question 2)*

Summarise all A2A delegate entries collected above into a routing table for confirmation before proceeding. For each delegated service, verify the three fields collected in Question 2 are complete:

| Service | Routing parameters | Client-side capability | Third-party agent ACN | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| {service collected in Q2} | {params collected in Q2} | {capability collected in Q2} | {ACN slug or "tbd"} | {platform link or human channel} |

Ask the user to confirm or correct any row. Once confirmed, this table is written verbatim into `SERVICE-CONTRACT.md` in Phase 4.

**Output mapping**:

- Each declared service → one entry in `skills[]` with `name`, `description`, and optional `trigger`
- A2A delegate services → also recorded in the routing table (see Phase 4)
- Hard limits → appended to `soul.character.boundaries`

---

## Phase 3 — Write persona.json

Merge Phase 1 brand soul and Phase 2 service skills into a complete `persona.json` using `presets/commercial-base` as the base. Apply this field mapping:


| Source                                | Target field                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Phase 1A/1B brand name                | `soul.identity.personaName`                                                                |
| Phase 1A/1B slug                      | `soul.identity.slug`                                                                       |
| Phase 1A/1B one-line bio              | `soul.identity.bio`                                                                        |
| Phase 1A/1B personality keywords      | `soul.character.personality`                                                               |
| Phase 1A/1B speaking style            | `soul.character.speakingStyle`                                                             |
| Phase 1A/1B core values + hard limits | `soul.character.boundaries` (combined as a single string; list items separated by newline) |
| Phase 1A/1B background / brand story  | `soul.character.background` (if available from distillation)                               |
| Phase 2 service skills list           | `skills[]` (each entry: `name`, `description`, optional `trigger`)                         |
| Phase 2 additional hard limits        | append to `soul.character.boundaries`                                                      |
| Base fields                           | all other fields from `presets/commercial-base/persona.json`                               |


Use `skills/brand-persona-skill/assets/brand.persona.template.json` as a writing guide. **Do not copy the template file directly** — it contains `_comment` fields that will cause schema validation errors. Write a new `persona.json` based on its structure, with all `_comment` keys removed.

**Gate — Soul Gate**: before proceeding, verify:

- `soul.identity.personaName` is non-empty
- `soul.identity.slug` matches `^[a-z0-9-]+$`
- `soul.identity.bio` is non-empty
- `soul.character.personality` is non-empty

If any field is missing, return to Phase 1 to collect it.

**Gate — Service Gate**: verify:

- `skills[]` contains at least one entry with a non-empty `name`
- `soul.character.boundaries` is non-empty

If either check fails, return to Phase 2.

---

## Phase 4 — Generate Persona Pack

Load `skills/open-persona/SKILL.md` and follow its generation instructions.

### Step 4a — Run the generator

```bash
npx openpersona create --config persona.json --output ./{slug}-skill
```

**Gate — Generate Gate**: if `openpersona create` exits non-zero, read the validation error, fix `persona.json`, and retry.

### Step 4b — Write behavior guide

Fill `skills/brand-persona-skill/assets/behavior-guide.template.md` with brand-specific values and write the result to `./{slug}-skill/soul/behavior-guide.md`, overwriting the framework default. Apply this mapping:


| Placeholder                    | Source                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{{brandName}}`                | Phase 1A/1B brand name                                                                                           |
| `{{oneLinerBio}}`              | Phase 1A/1B one-line bio                                                                                         |
| `{{onboardingQuestion_1/2/3}}` | 3 realistic first questions a customer would ask this brand                                                      |
| `{{blindspotRedirect}}`        | Escalation channels declared in Phase 2 (human handoff channel, official website, customer service number, etc.) |
| `{{confirmationRequiredOps}}`  | Action services from Phase 2 that require confirmation (list each by name)                                       |
| `{{brandVibe}}`                | Phase 1A/1B vibe / personality keywords                                                                          |
| `{{speakingStyleNote}}`        | Phase 1A/1B speaking style, condensed to one sentence                                                            |
| `{{brandBoundaries}}`          | `soul.character.boundaries` from Phase 3                                                                         |


### Step 4c — Generate trigger mapping table

From the Phase 2 `skills[]` list, write a trigger mapping table and append it to `./{slug}-skill/SKILL.md` under a new section `## Trigger Scenarios`. For each declared service skill, produce one or more rows:

```markdown
## Trigger Scenarios

| What the customer might ask | Corresponding operation |
|---|---|
| {realistic user phrasing for skill_1} | {skill_1 name and implementation method} |
| {realistic user phrasing for skill_2} | {skill_2 name and implementation method} |
...
```

Use natural customer language in the left column (questions a real customer would type, not technical names). Use the skill `name` + implementation method in the right column.

For A2A delegate skills, expand the right column to show all three execution tiers on separate lines. The table row format for an A2A delegate entry looks like this:

```markdown
| "How long is the wait? Can you add me to the queue?" | **queue-waitlist** (A2A delegate)<br>Tier 1: install `meituan-queue` → params: shop_id `4211342`<br>Tier 2: A2A → `acn://meituan-queue-agent` (tbd)<br>Tier 3: fallback → https://meituan.com/restaurant/4211342 |
```

More examples by industry (same table row format):

```markdown
| "I'd like to book a room for two nights" | **room-booking** (A2A delegate)<br>Tier 1: install `ctrip-booking` → params: hotel_id `bj-sanlitun-001`<br>Tier 2: A2A → `acn://ctrip-booking-agent` (tbd)<br>Tier 3: fallback → https://ctrip.com/hotels/bj-sanlitun-001 |

| "Can I book an appointment with Dr. Li?" | **appointment-booking** (A2A delegate)<br>Tier 1: install `wechat-health-booking` → params: clinic_id `88`, doctor_id `204`<br>Tier 2: A2A → `acn://wechat-health-agent` (tbd)<br>Tier 3: fallback → hospital registration portal |
```

The customer agent reads the three tiers and chooses the best available execution path at runtime.

### Step 4d — Write service contract

```
Copy skills/brand-persona-skill/references/SERVICE-CONTRACT.template.md
→ ./{slug}-skill/references/SERVICE-CONTRACT.md
```

Fill in all `{{placeholder}}` values with the information collected in Phase 2.

For the **Third-Party Agent Routing** section, use the routing table collected in Phase 2 Question 4:

- If the third-party agent's ACN address is known → fill in `acn://{slug}` and set status to `active`
- If only a platform link is known → fill in the URL and set status to `link-fallback`
- If neither is known → set status to `tbd` and fill in a human-readable fallback instruction

The routing table is the most important part of the contract for customer agents — it tells them the complete service map of this brand, including what this agent delegates and where.

---

## Phase 5 — Validate and Publish

**Gate — Contract Gate**: verify that `./{slug}-skill/agent-card.json` has a non-empty `skills[]` array. `agent-card.json` is auto-generated by `openpersona create` — its `skills[]` maps directly from `persona.json`'s `skills[]`. If it is empty, the root cause is an empty `skills[]` in Phase 3; return to Phase 2 to declare at least one service skill and regenerate.

Confirm the generated pack structure with the user:

```
{slug}-skill/
├── SKILL.md              ← brand agent behavior rules
├── persona.json          ← brand declaration
├── agent-card.json       ← A2A discovery credential
├── acn-config.json       ← ACN registration config
├── soul/
│   ├── injection.md      ← brand soul injection
│   ├── constitution.md   ← ethical foundation (inherited)
│   └── behavior-guide.md ← brand behavior guide
├── scripts/
│   └── state-sync.js     ← cross-session state management
└── references/
    ├── SERVICE-CONTRACT.md  ← service capabilities and boundaries
    └── SIGNAL-PROTOCOL.md   ← host integration guide
```

**Optional — Register on ACN**:

```bash
npx openpersona acn-register {slug} --endpoint https://your-agent-endpoint.example.com
```

This publishes the brand agent's `agent-card.json` to the Agent Communication Network so other agents can discover and call it without installing any brand-specific skill. The `--endpoint` flag is the only value the brand must supply — everything else (`agent-card.json`, `acn-config.json`) was auto-generated by `openpersona create`.

## Failure routing


| Gate          | On failure                                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Soul Gate     | Return to Phase 1, collect missing fields                       |
| Service Gate  | Return to Phase 2, add at least one service skill               |
| Generate Gate | Read openpersona validate error, fix persona.json fields, retry |
| Contract Gate | Return to Phase 2, verify skills[] is populated, regenerate     |


---

## Human approval required

Always ask for explicit confirmation before:

- Executing `take_number`, `place_order`, `cancel_order`, or any state-changing operation
- Publishing or registering the agent to ACN or any external network
- Any operation declared in the service contract as requiring confirmation
